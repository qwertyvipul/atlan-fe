# atlan-fe

## Development

The project was initialized using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) as the base UI components library and [MUI X Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/api/data-grid/data-grid/) to render React data grids.

### Steps

```bash
# Setup project
npx create-react-app atlan-fe

# Clean un-necessary code
# Install MUI
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## Questions

1. [ ] Do I have a good reason to wrap components inside a box?
